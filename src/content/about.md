I'm interested in **current and future AI systems that reflect and support diverse human experiences** across languages, cultures, values, and social contexts:

- Socio-technical AI Alignment: pluralistic alignment, scalable oversight, evaluation, and interpretability
- Multilingual & multicultural AI: investigate and improve cross-lingual and -cultural understanding in AI systems

I broadly care about AI Safety, AI ethics and impacts of AI on humans, society, and [more-than-human world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vakQsLYp4F0).

I am actively applying to Master's programs with thesis/research component in Computer Science, AI, NLP, or related fields for Fall 2026 admission. Simultaneously, I am also seeking research opportunities (internships, research assistantships, collaborations) in my interest areas for Winter/Summer 2026 and beyond.

I'm currently involved in [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.org/), [Cohere Labs Community](https://cohere.com/research/open-science), and [Algoverse](https://algoverseairesearch.org/). Previously, I [graduated in May 2025](/doc/bachelor.pdf) from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying Machine Learning & Statistics, while living with peers from 50+ countries and engaging civically in 6 cities as part of its [global rotation program](https://www.minerva.edu/global-immersion/): Seoul (South Korea), Chinese Taipei, Hyderabad (India), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Berlin (Germany).

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or just want to chat about AI research!
