I am interested in **making human knowledge work more accessible, productive, collaborative and
enjoyable** using natural language processing, human-computer interaction, data science, and
interdisciplinary insights:

- Accessibility: Low-resource, multilingual, and multicultural adaptation
- Productivity: Knowledge management and reasoning across modalities
- Collaboration: Human-AI bi-alignment, human-AI co-creation, human-AI-data relationship

[Knowledge can be broadly defined](./blog/knowledge-diversity), and so I care about many ways of
accessing and producing knowledge. In the long term, I envision a personalized, self-evolving
knowledge system externalized from human brain, but collaborate and augment human knowledge
and reasoning capabilities. 

I graduated in May 2025 from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying Machine Learning &
Statistics, while living and engaging civically in 6 cities 🇺🇸🇰🇷🇹🇼🇮🇳🇦🇷🇩🇪 as part of its global
rotation program.
