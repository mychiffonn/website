I am interested in researching and building **humanâ€“AI systems** that **reshape how people access,
trust, and collaborate** with:

- multilingual and cross-cultural adaptation
- **human-AI alignment**: data curation, pluralistic alignment, scalable oversight, benchmarking and holistic evaluation
- **human-AI collaboration**: building cooperative AI while maintaining human agency
- Other interests: social intelligence, social impacts of AI, AI ethics, AI & education

In the long term, I envision a **personalized, external 
knowledge system that co-evolve with humans and society** as we forget, re-prioritize, and integrate 
new knowlege over time.

I'm currently involved in [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.org/),
[Cohere Open Science Community](https://cohere.com/research/open-science), and
[CommonCrawl](https://commoncrawl.org/). 
I graduated in May 2025 from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying Machine Learning & Statistics, while living with
peers from 50+ countries and engaging civically in 6 cities ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª as part of its [global
rotation program](https://www.minerva.edu/global-immersion/).
