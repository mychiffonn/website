I'm interested in **diverse human experiences across languages, cultures, values, and social contexts** reflected and supported in **current and future AI systems**, through **AI evals** and **scaling environment** (data, agent harness, etc):

- Socio-technical AI Alignment: pluralistic alignment, evaluation (capabilities, propensities, safeguards), scalable oversight
- Multilingual & multicultural AI: evaluate and improve cross-lingual and -cultural understanding
- AI, internet, and critical thinking: misinformation, disinformation, and content moderation; AI literacy and education; human-AI interaction and co-evolution

I broadly care about AI Safety, AI ethics and impacts of AI on humans, society, and [more-than-human world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vakQsLYp4F0). I'm doing CoT monitoring research at [Algoverse](https://algoverseairesearch.org/) and multilingual agentic eval at [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.org/).

I am **applying to Master's with thesis/research in Computer Science, AI, NLP, or related fields for Fall 2026 intake** and seeking research opportunities (internships, research assistantships, collaborations) for Spring/Summer 2026 and beyond. See my [CV](/doc/cv.pdf) and [projects](/projects) for more details on my background and experience.

Previously, I graduated in May 2025 from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying Machine Learning & Statistics, while living with peers from 50+ countries and engaging civically in 6 cities as part of its [global rotation program](https://www.minerva.edu/global-immersion/): Seoul (South Korea), Chinese Taipei, Hyderabad (India), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Berlin (Germany).
