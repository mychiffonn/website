I'm interested in researching **AI systems that reflect and support diverse human experiences** across languages, cultures, values, and social contexts:

- Multilingual & multicultural AI: investigate and improve cross-lingual and -cultural understanding in AI systems
- Socio-technical AI Alignment: pluralistic alignment, scalable oversight, evaluation, cooperative AI, and interpretability
- Socially aware & personalizable AI: social intelligence, human-AI collaboration, steerable AI

I broadly care about AI Safety, AI ethics and impacts of AI on humans, society, and [more-than-human world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vakQsLYp4F0).

I'm currently involved in [Algoverse](https://algoverseairesearch.org/), [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.org/), and [Cohere Open Science Community](https://cohere.com/research/open-science). Previously, I [graduated in May 2025](/doc/bachelor.pdf) from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying Machine Learning & Statistics, while living with peers from 50+ countries and engaging civically in 6 cities as part of its [global rotation program](https://www.minerva.edu/global-immersion/): Seoul (South Korea), Chinese Taipei , Hyderabad (India), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Berlin (Germany).

As I'm still early in my research journey, I'm open to collaborations and conversations about any of the above topics. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or just want to chat about AI research!
