I'm interested in researching **human-AI systems that reflect and support diverse human experiences** across languages, cultures, values, and social contexts[^hyperlinks]:

- Multilingual & multicultural AI: understand and improve cross-lingual and -cultural understanding and representation
- AI Alignment: [pluralistic alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05070), scalable oversight, evaluation, cooperative AI.
- Socially aware AI: social intelligence, human-AI collaboration

To support my vertical research work, I'm learning about mechanistic interpretability and representation engineering. I broadly care about AI ethics and impacts of AI on humans, society, and [more-than-human world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vakQsLYp4F0).

[^hyperlinks]: Hyperlinks are not my work, but representative work or paradigms I'm interested in.

I'm currently involved in [Algoverse](https://algoverseairesearch.org/), [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.org/), and [Cohere Open Science Community](https://cohere.com/research/open-science).

For potential collaboration, please email me.
