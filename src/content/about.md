I am interested in researching and building **humanâ€“AI systems** that **reflect and support diversity of human patterns**:

- languages and culture: multilingual and multicultural AI
- values: [human-AI bidirectional alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09264), [pluralistic alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05070), holistic and robust evaluation, and ML fairness
- interactions with AI, others, and society: cooperative AI, human-AI collaboration, alternative UIs, social intelligence, social impacts of AI 

Instrumental to this goal is safe and trustworthy AI systems, so I also like to work on 
technical AI alignment and AI control.

I'm currently involved in [Algoverse](https://algoverseairesearch.org/), [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.org/), and 
[Cohere Open Science Community](https://cohere.com/research/open-science).

For potential collaboration, please email me.
