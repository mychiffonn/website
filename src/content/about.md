I am interested in researching and building **humanâ€“AI systems** that **reshape how people access,
trust, and collaborate around _knowledge_**.

- Inclusivity: building systems that adapt across languages, cultures, and modalities.
- Safety: caliberating reliability and trust, knowledge editing and unlearning, and memory
  mechanisms
- Collaboration: Human-AI bidrectional alignment, collaborative dynamics, and synergy
- Other interests: data-centric AI, social impacts of AI, AI ethics, AI & education

Knowledge can be broadly defined, and so I care about many ways and aspects of
accessing and producing knowledge. In the long term, I envision a **personalized, external 
knowledge system that co-evolve with humans and society** as we forget, re-prioritize, and integrate 
new knowlege over time.

I'm currently involved in [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.org/),
[Cohere Open Science Community](https://cohere.com/research/open-science), and
[CommonCrawl](https://commoncrawl.org/). 
I graduated in May 2025 from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying Machine Learning & Statistics, while living with
peer from 50+ countries and engaging civically in 6 cities ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª as part of its global
rotation program.
