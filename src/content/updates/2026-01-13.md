Got to final round of a few AI safety fellowships for winter/spring 2026, including [ERA Fellowship](https://erafellowship.org/), [CBAI Fellowship](https://www.cbai.ai/), [Pivotal Fellowship](https://www.pivotal-research.org/fellowship). Sad for rejection but grateful for the experience! Looking forward to applying again.
