Epistemic justice, in its simplest form, is about fairness in knowledge. It refers to the idea that
everyone should have equal access to knowledge, be heard and respected as a knower, and have their
knowledge valued and utilized appropriately. It is closely linked to social justice, as it
recognizes how power structures can influence who is believed, whose knowledge is valued, and who
has access to opportunities for learning and sharing knowledge.
