This report analyzes the drop in user engagement observed in Yammer, an enterprise social networking
platform, from late July to late August 2014. I identified that **long-term mobile users** became
disengaged while email click-through rates dropped from 40% to 30% despite stable open rates (around
30%). I thus provided targeted recommendations for mobile experience optimization, email content
improvement, and enhanced user feedback mechanisms.
