I developed an AI-powersed personal knowledge assistant using LlamaIndex framework with OpenAI API
for RAG architecture. I allowed me to quickly receive answers and insights from my knowledge base in
Obsidian. The project also had robust data processing pipeline to ingest Obsidian-flavored Markdown
content and PDFs (of textbooks and assignments).
