My Obsidian vault included a mix of notes and assignments. I tested several classification
approaches to automatically organize and categorize my learning resources with 85% test accuracy, F1
and AUC scores for Naive Bayes and 87% for Support Vector Machine. I also performed error analysis
and plotted keywords associated the most with "assignments" as identified by Naive Bayes.
