In a team of 4, we researched and developed a full-stack Progressive Web Application that allow
users and/or their caregivers to track seizure episodes and log different types of symptoms and
medications. Users receive predictive warnings and get insights into which symptoms correlated with
their episodes (respectively using XGBoost and LTSM models).

I mainly managed sprints, developed and tested Flask (Python) backend and database, maintained QA
and reviewed PRs. However, I also helped develop features and services in React.
