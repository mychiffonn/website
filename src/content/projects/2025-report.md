As a Lead Peer Tutor for a 10-week Python programming lab, I created a data-driven, easy-to-navigate
retrospective report filled with 20 recommendations ranked by priority, including scaffolding
testing and debugging skills more effectively, and improving lab notebooks with better code
checkers. I worked with many data sources (student and peer tutor surveys, Google Sheet trackers,
Google Colab comments) and automated some using Google Drive API.
