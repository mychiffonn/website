- I love teaching and other activities that involve explaining (e.g., writing). I can have grounded discussion in languages, moral and political philosophy, DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion).

- I'm an event planner and organizer. In high school, I led Vietcode (19-20) and Developh Vietnam (20-21), and wore many hats at SheCodes Vietnam (18-19) and AngelHack Vietnam (2020), planning and organizing tech talks, webinars, hackathons, and meetups. On smaller scales, I'm responsible for family travel planning and friend hangouts, particularly potlucks, board game nights, and powerpoint parties.

- I'm a minimalist and flexitarian. I cook vegetarian (🚫 meat and dairy, ✅ eggs and sauce), but I'm okay with meat ingredients when eating out or having food prepared for me.

- I [mostly read fiction](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/mychiffonn) or essays. My favorite authors are [Audre Lorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audre_Lorde) (American, non-fiction) and [Rebecca F. Kuang](https://www.rfkuang.com/about) (Amercian, fiction).

- I'm learning Mandarin Chinese (band 4/B1) and French (A2).

- I have 2 [Tarot](https://labyrinthos.co/collections/tarot-decks-for-sale/products/seventh-sphere-tarot-deck-modern-tarot-de-marseille-rose-gold) and 1 [Lenormand](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/lenormand-cards) decks, which I read for fun and reflection. My views on astrology are similar to [this video](https://youtu.be/IEc1gti61eQ?si=lfaJTXNMG5FLlont&t=2228): may not be scientifically valid, still helpful.
