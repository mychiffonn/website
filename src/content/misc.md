- I love teaching and other activities that involve explaining (e.g., writing). I can dabble across languages, moral and political philosophy, sex and gender studies.

- I'm an event planner and organizer. I led Vietcode (19-20) and Developh Vietnam (20-21), and organized SheCodes Vietnam (18-19) and AngelHack Vietnam (2020): tech talks, webinars, hackathons, and meetups. On smaller scales, I'm responsible for family travel planning and friend hangouts, particularly potlucks, board game nights, and powerpoint parties.

- I [mostly read fiction](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/mychiffonn) or essays. My favorite authors are [Audre Lorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audre_Lorde) (American, non-fiction) and [Rebecca F. Kuang](https://www.rfkuang.com/about) (Amercian, fiction).

- I'm a minimialist, language learner (Mandarin Chinese & French), and plant-based cook. I have 2 [Tarot](https://labyrinthos.co/collections/tarot-decks-for-sale/products/seventh-sphere-tarot-deck-modern-tarot-de-marseille-rose-gold) and 1 [Lenormand](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/lenormand-cards) decks, which I read for fun and reflection.
