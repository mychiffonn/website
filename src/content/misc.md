- I graduated in May 2025 from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying Machine Learning & Statistics, 
while living with peers from 50+ countries and engaging civically in 6 cities ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª 
as part of its [global rotation program](https://www.minerva.edu/global-immersion/). 

- I'm a minimialist, [avid reader](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/mychiffonn)
([Storygraph stats](https://app.thestorygraph.com/stats/mychiffonn?year=2025)), 
language learner, and plant-based cook. 

- I love organzing events, from hackathons to friend hangouts, 
particularly potlucks and board game nights.

- I love teaching, learning, and deliberating. 
I can dabble across topics of linguistics, gender equality, 
justice (social, environmental, algorithmic, epistemic justice), and political philosophy.
