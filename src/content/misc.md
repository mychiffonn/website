- I love teaching and other activities that involve explaining (e.g., writing, science communication). I TAed 2.5 years for CS courses in undergrad and am still mentoring students through [Curious Cardinals](https://curiouscardinals.com/).

- I'm an event planner and organizer. In high school, I led Vietcode (19-20) and Developh Vietnam (20-21), and wore many hats at SheCodes Vietnam (18-19) and AngelHack Vietnam (2020), planning and organizing tech talks, webinars, hackathons, and meetups. On smaller scales, I'm responsible for family travel planning and friend hangouts.

- As a 🌱 flexitarian, I cook vegetarian (🚫 meat and dairy, ✅ eggs and sauce), but I'm okay with meat when food is prepared for me.

- I mostly [read fiction](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/mychiffonn) or essays. My favorite authors are [Audre Lorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audre_Lorde) (American, non-fiction) and [Rebecca F. Kuang](https://www.rfkuang.com/about) (Amercian, fiction). I can have grounded discussion in languages, moral and political philosophy, DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion).

- I'm learning Mandarin Chinese (band 4/B1) and French (A2).

- I'm agnostic, with wonderful friends that are [Christian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/candace-lee-/), [Buddhist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teapq/), [Muslim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alinasalman/), and more.

- I have 2 [Tarot](https://labyrinthos.co/collections/tarot-decks-for-sale/products/seventh-sphere-tarot-deck-modern-tarot-de-marseille-rose-gold) and 1 [Lenormand](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/lenormand-cards) decks, which I read for fun and reflection. My views on astrology are similar to [this video](https://youtu.be/IEc1gti61eQ?si=lfaJTXNMG5FLlont&t=2228): may not be scientifically valid, still helpful.
