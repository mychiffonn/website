- I'm a minimialist, [avid reader](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/mychiffonn), language learner (Mandarin Chinese & French), and plant-based cook. I have 2 [Tarot](https://labyrinthos.co/collections/tarot-decks-for-sale/products/seventh-sphere-tarot-deck-modern-tarot-de-marseille-rose-gold) and 1 [Lenormand](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/lenormand-cards) decks, which I read for fun and reflection.

- I'm an event planner and organizer. I led Vietcode (19-20) and Developh Vietnam (20-21), and organized SheCodes Vietnam (18-19) and AngelHack Vietnam (2020) hackathons. On smaller scales, I'm responsible for family travel planning and friend hangouts, particularly potlucks, board game nights, and powerpoint parties.

- I love teaching, learning, and deliberating. I can dabble across linguistics, sex and gender, justice (social, environmental, algorithmic, epistemic justice), and political philosophy, thanks to global studies, wonderful friends and a lot of rabbit holes.
