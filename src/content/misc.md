I'm a minimialist, [avid reader](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/mychiffonn)
([Storygraph stats](https://app.thestorygraph.com/stats/mychiffonn?year=2025)), 
language learner, and plant-based cook. 
I love organzing events, from hackathons to friend hangouts, 
particularly potlucks and board game nights.

I love teaching, learning, and deliberating. 
I can dabble across topics of linguistics, gender equality, 
justice (social, environmental, algorithmic, epistemic justice), and political philosophy.
